Although various options have been offered in Belgium for several decades to invest indirectly in real estate, the  \n  \teSTOKK ERC 20 Tokens offered in the context of this issue (the “ Offered  eSTOKK ERC 20 Tokens ”) are the first debt \n  \tinstruments to be issued in the form of tokens created through Distributed Ledger Technology (hereinafter “ DLT ”).

Any (temporary) \n  \treduction or absence of rental income or a realized loss in value is also exclusively borne by the investors who have \n  \tsubscribed to the Offered  eSTOKK ERC 20 Tokens. Consequently, the income and risks of different real estate are not \n  \tpooled.\n  \t \n  \tThe concentration risk mentioned above means, among other things, that if the rental income is disappointing, this may \n  \thave an adverse effect on the return of the  eSTOKK ERC 20 Tokens on offer. If the sale of the Real Estate is accompanied by \n  \ta loss in value, for example as a result of a general decrease in real estate prices, each Token Holder can only claim a pro\n  \t  rata part of the sale proceeds.\n  \t \n  \tUnder no circumstances can the Issuer be held liable for disappointing Proceeds.","_6_paragraph":"<div>##*Risks associated with a possible insolvency of the Issuer## <br></div><div>There is a risk that, as a result of the bankruptcy of the Issuer, the Token Holders would not be able to recover the \n  \tamounts to which they are entitled.
